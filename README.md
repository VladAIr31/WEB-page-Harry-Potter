# WEB-page-Harry-Potter
A web page featuring a summary of the second Harry Potter book, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The page includes multiple hidden sections, such as the Chamber of Secrets, where a Snake game features characters from the book along with their images. As each character is "eaten," they become part of the snakeâ€™s tail.

It also includes a form that, based on the selected answers, sorts you into one of the four Hogwarts houses. On the form page, there's also a link to view previous quiz results, which are stored in local storage.
